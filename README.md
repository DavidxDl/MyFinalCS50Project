<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm David Elich</h1>
<h3 align="center">A CS50 Sudent from ViÃ±a del Mar, Chile</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently Studying to become a **Web or Game Dev**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **C# and Unity**

- A did this game, for my Final Project at CS50 [Adventures of Duck50](https://github.com/DavidxDl/MyFinalCS50Project)

<h3 align="center">About The Game:</h3>
<h5 align="center">
  Adventures of Duck50 is A Plataform game, i did it as my Final Project for CS50.
</h5>
<p align="center">
  you play as the lovely duck from CS50, a lot of Adventures are waiting for you, in every level, your goal is to get to the laptop to help people debug their code <3
</p>
<p align="center">
  but there will be alot of obstacles in the way so be carefull!
</p>
<h5 align="middle">Process</h5>
<p align="middle">i had to learn c# for this project, is similarto c, but you dont have to manually allocate memory.
                  everything in this game engine is a game object, the player, the obstacles the ground etc, so you have to program as a object oriented programming patter, wich is cool,</p>
<p align="middle">i move the caracter directly trough his trasform thing that is not that much used, but since is a tiny game i stick to it, the most popular way of moving the caracter is by doing it with physics, adding velocity to it, i'll do that for my next game, overall it was a good experience to work on it </p>

<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>
<p align="center">I have never thought i would develop games, it all started with a video of The Coding Train on Youtube, he is a proggramer that does a lot of coding challenges in p5.js.</p>
<p align="center">i start with his challenge on coding the snake game on p5 js, and i fell in love with all of it, i stared doing a lot of games with p5, and then find out about unity, and on my journy of learning unity i learn about CS50, i thought it would be nice to do that courses to learn more about programming i thought it would be helpfull and it would help me with my game dev career and it was!</p>
<p align="center">
  CS50 it changed everything for me, it made me love more everyting about programming and i am eager to learn more about this world!, hope i could become a good game or Web Developer.
</p>
<p align="center">
  i struggle a bit with this game, because i didnt had the enought time to completed the way i wanted, i suffer with some health issues lately, and a lot of personal thing, but am glad i got to finished, even tho not with as much levels as i wanted.
